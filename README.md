# Generative-Adversarial-Networks

In this assignment, I will play around with adversarial techniques in deep learning. The main goal is to build some understanding of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). However, I will also take a look at adversarial training, which is a collection of methods for fooling neural networks. Although both approaches are completely unrelated, it turns out that is possible to build GANs, starting from adversarial examples.
